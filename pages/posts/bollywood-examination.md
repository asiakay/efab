Bollywood has a reputation for promoting the offensive practice of brownface, where actors' skin is temporarily darkened to portray characters from disadvantaged backgrounds. Critics say that Bollywood often prefers this approach to actually hiring performers who have naturally darker skin, thus perpetuating discrimination and inequality in the industry. The move was slammed by some Indian media outlets, commentators and on social media. However, despite criticisms, the popularity of films that use brownface such as "Super 30" and "Gully Boy" suggest that Bollywood is yet to come under significant public pressure for a practice that many people consider racist and offensive.
