title: git x coding + getting started
---
Here are some instructions on getting started with Git for a student with no prior experience and a goal of becoming a software engineer:

Install Git on your computer: You can download and install Git from the official website (https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Create a GitHub account: GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides a place to store your code and collaborate with others. Create an account at https://github.com/.

Learn the basic Git commands: Git has a few basic commands that you'll use frequently such as git clone, git add, git commit, git push and git pull. You can find more information on these commands and others in the Pro Git book (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

Create your first repository: A repository is like a folder for your code. To create your first repository, go to your GitHub account and click on the "New repository" button. Give your repository a name and a short description. You can make it public or private.

Start using Git: Now that you have Git installed, a GitHub account and a repository, you can start using Git to track your changes and collaborate with others. You can use the command line or a Git client such as SourceTree or GitKraken.

It's also important to practice git and use it regularly. You can find open-source projects on Github and start contributing to them, or create your own personal projects and use Git to version control them.
